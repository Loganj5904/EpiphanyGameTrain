I want a complex gridbased game where a player can place 1 (ASCII) character on a grid per turn
each character has some point value that synergizes with other characters
maybe the point values and synergies are randomized, and each game is unique
Agents then need to figure out a 20 turn formation to beat their opponent
it wouldn't just be a game of finding the highest score, because many characters might counter many other characters on the opposing side
what formations can be found/created? how quickly will dominant strategies be developed


game ideas:
    rules:
        except for the first character, each character has to be played adjacent to another character on the board
        each player plays at the same time, and only gets a visual of their opponents board after the game state updates for both players at once
        points are counted at the end
        to determine fitness, take the win count, not the score disparity/score in general

    character ideas:
        variable number of base points (randomize number)
        number of points based on certain character counts (randomize character)
        number of points based on certain character counts of the opponent (randomize character)
        number of points based on character count adjacent (randomize number, maybe randomize character)
        number of points based on character count not adjacent (randomize number, maybe randomize character)
        multiplier of adjecent characters, maybe 1-4 random directions (randomize multiplier, randomize direction, randomize character)
        multiplier of certain other characters (randomize multiplier, randomize character)
        number of points based on the number of copies of itself
        number of points based on character count in same row/column (randomize character, randomize row/column, potential multiplier)
        cancel out enemy character (randomize enemy character)
        subtract point count of certain enemy character (randomize enemy character, randomize point count, randomize if scalable)
        subtract point count of enemy (randomize point count)

        maybe many of these conditions can apply to both sides
            ex: multiplier of certain other characters, applies to both sides, but maybe value is higher

        many characters should have more than 1 condition to add complexity

        some of these characters can have count conditionals to gain additional benefits, but have to commit to a larger count of a character, which could be countered
        randomize conditional character count
        randomize conditional effect:
            could be any of the above effects
            maybe needs to be curated list


        maybe when training, seperate into multiple groups/allow for more exploration to see more potential strategies

        decision tree size:
            c = character count
            n = number of characters placed
